    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><em>Gỏi Cuốn</em>, or Spring Rolls, are a famous dish found in Vietnam. 
        There are many ways to make these Spring Rolls, 
        and you can get creative with what you decide to put inside the rolled-up rice paper.</p>
    <p>This recipe will use shrimp as its protein and a basic fish sauce, <em>Nuốc Mắm</em>, for dipping. </p>  
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>  
    <ul>
        <li>Rice paper</li>
        <li>Shrimp</li>
        <li>Your favorite vegetables</li>
        <li>Fish sauce</li>
        <li>Black vinegar</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Chilli peppers</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Quất, or some type of citrus</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil your shrimp.</li>
        <li>While your shrimp is boiling, prep and cut your desired vegetables. My favorites are lettuce, cucumbers, konegi, pakuchi, shiso/oba.  </li>
        <li>When your shrimp have boiled, deshell them and cut into halves.</li>
        <li>Cut your chilli peppers and garlic, or mash with a mortar-and-pestal - if you're feeling fancy.</li>
        <li>Mix the chilli peppers and garlic together with a mixture of fish sauce, black vinegar, sugar, and your choice of squeezed citrus juice. Ask my wife, Linh, what the proper ratio is. </li>
        <li>Roll up the shrimp and veggies into the rice paper.</li>
        <li>Dunk your rolled up goodness into the sauce and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
